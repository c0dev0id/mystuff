"cpuid" dumps results from the x86 CPUID instruction, and decodes
information from certain leaves.

NOTE: the code in this software to bind to a specific CPU is non functional
on OpenBSD; if you are trying to find information from different cores, you'll
need to run it multiple times until the process is scheduled on the core of
interest.
